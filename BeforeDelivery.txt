Important notes:

1. Update "date_default_timezone_set('Asia/Dhaka');" to "date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Amsterdam');"



Changes:
1. Vendor product add: I found a mistake that sell_count was adding when vendor add a product. I change it to stock. Case sell_count will counting after product sell. Not before sell. Action performed link:http://127.0.0.1:8000/vendor/products/add

2. Available quantity wise product view. If product sell_count count is equal to stock then that product will stop showing to page. Action performed link:http://127.0.0.1:8000/event/7/stallhall/22
